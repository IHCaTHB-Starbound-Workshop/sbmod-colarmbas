Do not use at the same time as the Core version of this mod.
Does not add any new colors, just new combinations of existing colors.
This can be used as a tool for easily adding new color options to generated weapons, a sample patch and guide will be published to the forums.
This version keeps all weapon rarities generating from the same color files, so there is no difference aesthetically between them.
